# ðŸ¥¤ Juice Creator

Juice Creator is a fresh and vibrant web project made for the **Summer of Making** programme.  
Itâ€™s all about celebrating colorful juice creations â€” from the sweetness of strawberry to the smoothness of avocado and the zing of orange.

## âœ¨ Whatâ€™s Inside
- **Simple & Clean Design** â€“ Easy on the eyes, easy to explore  
- **Responsive Layout** â€“ Works beautifully on phones, tablets, and desktops  
- **Smooth Navigation** â€“ No clutter, just straight to the good stuff  
- **Bright Visuals** â€“ A colorful, refreshing feel that matches the theme  

## ðŸŽ¯ Why I Built This
I wanted a project thatâ€™s both fun and functional â€” something that looks good, works well, and shows what I can do with **HTML**, **CSS**, and a dash of **JavaScript**.

## ðŸš€ How to Use
1. Download or clone the project  
2. Open `index.html` in your favorite browser  
3. Explore the juices and enjoy the experience  

## ðŸ’¡ Future Ideas
- Add more juice flavors & recipes
